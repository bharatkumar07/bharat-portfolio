                My name is Bharatkumar Choudhary, and I am a Second Year Post Graduate student.
                Currently studying at IIT Guwahati, majoring in Master of Science(MSc)
                in Mathematics & Computing. I have completed by graduation at Mumbai University.
                In the final year of my Graduation, I prepared for an Entrance exam called IITJAM 
                to get admission into the Top Institutes of India and secured AIR(All India Rank) 21
                and got chance to take my further education in prestigious College IIT Guwahati.
                <br/>
                In my post graduation, I am currently upgrading my skills in computer programming languages
                such as C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and learning web development.
                <br/>
                I am intrested in Software development field and I am very excited to begin my 
                carrier in this field. I look forward to upgrade my skills and putting all 
                my education and acquired skills to use.
                My goal is to obtain internship in my summer vacation so that I can be best prepared 
                for job opportunities after my post graduation.
                <br/>
                Other than coding, I have good problem solving skills. I love music and always
                listen music as I feel peaceful.
                <br/>
                Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. Have a great day!
